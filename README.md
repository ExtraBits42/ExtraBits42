- ðŸ”­ I'm working on MLsys;
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning and will continuously study Python, CUDA, LLM and mathematics, etc;
- âš¡ Fun fact: Running, Music, Sleep and Delicious food;

I firmly believe that by maintaining consistent daily efficient work, even the toughest challenges can be incorporated into our routine and cease to be overwhelming. I adhere to the principles of gradual accumulation and long-termism.
